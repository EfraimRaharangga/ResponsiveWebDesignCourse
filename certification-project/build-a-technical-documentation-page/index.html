          PHP (Hypertext Preprocessor) is a widely-used, open-source server-side
          scripting language designed specifically for web development. Unlike
          client-side languages like HTML or JavaScript, PHP code is executed on
          the server, generating HTML which is then sent to the client's
          browser. Here's the key features of PHP
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Server-Side: Runs on the server, keeping your source code hidden
            from users.
          </li>
          <li>
            Database Integration: Seamlessly connects with MySQL, PostgreSQL,
            Oracle, and more.
          </li>
          <li>
            Large Ecosystem: Powers platforms like WordPress, Wikipedia, and
            Laravel.
          </li>
        </ul>

          Before you can run PHP, you need an environment that can process it.
          and here's what you need:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Web Server: Apache or Nginx are the most common choices.</li>
          <li>PHP Engine: The latest stable version (currently PHP 8.x).</li>
          <li>Database: MySQL or MariaDB is the standard pairing.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Basic_Syntax">
        <header>Basic Syntax</header>
        <p>
          Every PHP script begins and ends with specific tags. This tells the
          server to start interpreting the code as PHP. Here's the example of
          simple php's code
        </p>
        <code>
          &lt;? <br />
          php echo "Hello, World!";<br />
          ?&gt;
        </code>
        <p>Key Rules</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Each statement must end with a semicolon (;).</li>
          <li>Variables start with a dollar sign ($), such as $myVariable.</li>
          <li>
            PHP is case-sensitive for variables but not for built-in functions
            (though it's best practice to be consistent).
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="PHP_Lifecycle">
        <header>PHP Lifecycle</header>
        <p>
          Understanding how a PHP script executes is fundamental to debugging
          and optimization. When a request hits the server, the PHP interpreter
          starts at the top of the file and moves downward. It ignores anything
          outside of the <span class="code"> &lt;?php ... ?&gt; </span>
          tags, passing it directly to the output. This allows you to mix PHP
          logic with HTML seamlessly.
        </p>
        <p>
          This "stateless" nature is a core concept. Every time a page is
          refreshed, the script starts from scratch. It doesn't "remember" what
          happened in the previous request unless you specifically use sessions,
          cookies, or a database to persist data.
        </p>
        <p>Basic Syntax Example</p>
        <code>
          &lt;?php <br />
          // This is a PHP comment <br />
          $greeting = "Welcome to my site"; <br />
          echo "&lt;h1 &gt;" . $greeting . "&lt;/h1 &gt;"; <br />
          ?&gt;
        </code>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Variables_and_Data_Types">
        <header>Variables and Data Types</header>
        <p>
          Variables in PHP are the primary way we store and manipulate data.
          Every variable starts with a dollar sign ($), followed by a name. One
          of PHP's most flexible features is that it is "loosely typed." This
          means you don't have to explicitly tell PHP that a variable will hold
          a string or a number; the engine determines the type automatically.
        </p>
        <p>Primary Data Types:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>String: Textual data like "Hello World".</li>
          <li>Integer: Whole numbers like</li>
          <li>100. Float: Decimal numbers like 10.5.</li>
          <li>Boolean: Conditional values, either true or false.</li>
          <li>Null: A variable with no value assigned.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Constants">
        <header>Constants</header>
        <p>
          While variables are designed to change, constants are used for values
          that should remain the same throughout the entire execution of your
          script. You define them using the define() function or the const
          keyword. Common uses include storing database credentials or site-wide
          configuration settings. Once defined, they cannot be changed or
          "unset."
        </p>
        <p>
          Predefined "Magic" Constants: PHP provides special constants that
          change based on where they are used:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <span class="code">__LINE__</span>: The current line number in the
            file.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="code">__FILE__</span>: The full path and filename of
            the file.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="code"> __DIR__</span>: The directory of the file.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Conditional_Logic">
        <header>Conditional Logic</header>
        <p>
          Conditional statements are the "brain" of your application. They allow
          your code to take different paths based on specific criteria. The
          if...else structure is the most common, checking if a condition is
          true before executing code.
        </p>
        <p>Common Structures</p>
        <ul>
          <li>If/Else: Standard binary decision making.</li>
          <li>
            Switch: Efficient for comparing one variable against many values.
          </li>
          <li>
            Match (PHP 8+): A modern, more concise version of switch that
            returns a value.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <code>
          $status = 200; $message = match($status) { <br />
          200 => "Success",<br />
          404 => "Not Found",<br />
          default => "Unknown Error",<br />
          };
        </code>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Loops">
        <header>Loops</header>
        <p>
          Loops execute the same block of code repeatedly until a condition is
          met. This is essential for tasks like displaying products or reading
          lines from a file.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>For Loop: Used when you know the exact number of iterations.</li>
          <li>While Loop: Runs as long as a certain condition remains true.</li>
          <li>
            Foreach Loop: Specifically designed to walk through every item in an
            array without needing a counter.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <code>
          $colors = ["Red", "Green", "Blue"];<br />
          foreach ($colors as $value) {<br />
          echo "Color: $value &lt;br&gt;";<br />
          }
        </code>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Functions">
        <header>Functions</header>
        <p>
          A function is a reusable block of code. Instead of writing the same
          logic ten times, you wrap it in a function and "call" it whenever
          needed. This follows the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle. In
          modern PHP, you can also use "Type Hinting" to ensure functions
          receive the correct data types.
        </p>
        <p>Defining a Functions :</p>
        <code>
          function calculateTotal(int $price, int $tax): int {<br />
          return $price + $tax; <br />
          } <br />
          echo calculateTotal(100, 10); // Outputs 110
        </code>
